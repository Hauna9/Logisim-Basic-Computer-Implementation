# Logisim-Basic-Computer-Implementation
Logisim project implementing a basic computer that simulates a memory system and arithmetic/logic unit and registers, using a PC registers and a control unit(decoders, sequence counters and logic gates).   A report is included that contains each instruction used with its timing and control signals circuits developed for each register and component
